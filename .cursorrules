# Cursor AI Rules

# These rules will be applied to all AI interactions in this project

## Confidence and Clarification Rules

- Always ask clarifying questions when confidence is below 95%
- If instructions are ambiguous or could be interpreted multiple ways, ask for clarification before proceeding
- When making assumptions, explicitly state them and ask for confirmation
- If a task involves multiple possible approaches, present options and ask which to use

## Code Quality Rules

- Always follow Python PEP 8 style guidelines
- Include docstrings for functions and classes
- Add type hints where appropriate
- Write clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Include error handling for potential failure points

## Communication Rules

- Explain your reasoning when making decisions
- Provide context for why you're choosing specific implementations
- Ask before making significant architectural changes
- Confirm before deleting or substantially modifying existing code

## Learning Context Rules

- Remember this is a learning environment (Python Pro Bootcamp)
- Explain concepts and best practices when implementing solutions
- Suggest alternative approaches when educational value exists
- Point out common pitfalls and how to avoid them

## Safety Rules

- Never make destructive changes without explicit confirmation
- Always backup or preserve existing functionality when refactoring
- Test suggestions thoroughly before recommending
- Warn about potential security implications of code changes
